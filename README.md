# Password-generator-and-Strength-checker

This is a beginner-friendly **Python project** that helps users:

- ✅ **Generate secure random passwords**
- ✅ **Check the strength** of any custom password they enter
- ✅ Use a **simple menu-driven CLI interface** with looping and input validation

---

## 🚀 Features

- Choose between **generating a password** or **checking an existing one**
- Password strength rated as: `Weak ⚠️`, `Medium 👍`, or `Strong 💪`
- Uses:
  - `random` and `string` modules for generation
  - Conditional logic for strength scoring
- Keeps running until the user chooses to exit

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Python core concepts: `input()`, `if/else`, `while`, `functions`
- Creating reusable logic using functions
- Using built-in modules like `random`, `string`, and `any()`
- Structuring and uploading a project to GitHub
